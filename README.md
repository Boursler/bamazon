# bamazon
## CLI database app which makes use of MYSQL and Node.js. 
Packages: <br/>
* Inquirer <br/>
* Dotenv <br/>
* MYSQL <br/>

**There are 2 views available**: a customer view, which allows a customer to purchase from available products, and a manager view, which allows a manager to check inventory, add low inventory, or add a new product. 

You can access the different views by running either **bamazonCustomer.js** or **bamazonManager.js**. Seeds and Schema for the database are provided in the repository as well. The database is password-protected, and dotenv is used to create an environment variable.
